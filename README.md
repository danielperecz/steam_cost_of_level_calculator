## Explanation
Calculates the cost of reaching a certain level on Steam, if you were to use badges to level up. One badge awards 100 XP (experience points), and there can be 5-15 cards in a badge.

## Example usage
![Example](https://i.imgur.com/IqUC4hn.png "Example")
* The `Cost` value is the cost of reaching your desired level, in whatever currency you have used (in the `Cost of one card` field).
* In this specific example I use EUR, so that's 4 cents per card, meaning the cost of one badge is `4c * 5`, i.e. `20 cents` - or `0.2 EUR`.
